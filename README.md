# Deep Neural Network & One look on confidence probabilities 
In this work project submitted at Ecole Polytechnique & Ensta Paris (IP Paris), we did an empirical analysis on regularisation and optimisation of the most popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images classification (Alex Nets, GoogLeNet and ResNet50) and and understand all the steps and methodology behind. We obtained a training accuracy of 82.91\% and a validation accuracy of 81.69\%. Furthermore, the model was validated on the STL 10 dataset which is inspired by the CIFAR 10 dataset and a significant test accuracy was obtained. Our analysis illustrate that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognise objects with better accuracy compared to Alex Net and VGG. Furthermore, we defind a confidence value of each model. The performance of the trained CNNs varies considerably between the different object categories and we will therefore discuss possible reasons for this phenomenon related to the training parameters and hyper parameters.
